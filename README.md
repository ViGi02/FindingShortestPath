# FindingShortestPath – Transportation Problem Solver

A Java program that models a transportation network as a graph and uses **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to find the most cost-effective shipping routes between suppliers and customers.

## Features
- Represents locations as a Graph Abstract Data Type (ADT)
- Calculates the shortest path and total transportation cost
- Minimizes supply-chain costs by optimizing routes

## Methodology
- Graph ADT to represent locations and distances
- Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path computation
- Optimizes shipments to meet supply and demand constraints

## Tech Stack & Requirements
- **Java** (JDK 17 or later recommended)
- Command-line interface
- JavaFX libraries
